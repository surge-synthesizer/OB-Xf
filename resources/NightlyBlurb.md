**OB-Xf Nightly Build**

This Nightly build contains a copy of OB-Xf built at the tip of the code. It contains the beta release of OB-Xf.

To install on your system, download the appropriate installer and run it. On mac, that's the dmg file, on windows, that's the exe file, and on linux, that's the deb file. 

We also provide a zip file for windows and linux, but when using those you are responsible for also downloading and installing the assets from the assets zip, and installing them in the right location. If you take this route and get it wrong, run the synth and it will show you where it looked for assets.

We have a few items left to do between beta and a 1.0, including finishing midi learn, embedding a vector skin so the synth runs asset free, and resolving other bugs in the beta period, but the synth is stable now.

Enjoy!
