**OB-Xf Nightly Build**

If you are coming here from the [SynthAnatomy Article](https://synthanatomy.com/2025/09/surge-synth-team-ob-xf.html), welcome, but please note that this is still late alpha / early beta softare and subject to change.

This Nightly build contains a copy of OB-Xf built at the tip of the code. 

For macOS users, the dmg file is a signed complete installer which will install assets and plugins in the appropriate place. If you run the installer you don't need to take any other action.

For Windows and Linux users, we are still working on installers. So you first need to grab the zip file and manually install the plugins, then grab the assets file and stage them.

Once that is done you must also grab the -assets.zip file here, which you must install into your Documents folder

Windows: `%DOCUMENTS%/Surge Synth Team/OB-Xf`

Linux: Run the synth without assets and it will tell you your OS-specific directories.

Assets can change with installs so please update both regularly.

Improving the win/lin installer is on our list.
