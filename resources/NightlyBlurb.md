**OB-Xf Nightly Build**

This page contains a copy of OB-Xf built from the head of the repository. We consider this a beta build.

To install on your system, download the appropriate installer (dmg, exe, deb) and run it.

Notice to windows HDPI users. We are chasing a crashing bug with the bitmap skin in windows HDPI in plugins, so this build has HDPI off for the VST3 and CLAP, and the bitmap theme may be fuzzy.

We also provide a ZIP archive for Windows and Linux, but when using these you are responsible for placing the assets from the assets.zip file to the right location on your system. If you take this route and get it wrong, run the standalone and it will show you where it attempted to look for assets.

We have a few items left to do between beta and a 1.0, including finishing MIDI learn UI/UX and resolving other bugs in the beta period, but the synth is stable now.

Enjoy!
