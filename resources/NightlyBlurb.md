**OB-Xf Nightly Build**

This page contains a copy of OB-Xf built from the head of the repository. 

In mid Nov we decided to pause the beta after both a collection of state bugs and user confusino about the bank-vs-patch mechnanism. Our original plan of 'deal with a patch browser later' ended up being untenable.

So probably not a 1.0 release in 2025. This beta works pretty well but we are making some big changes which means the next beta may have a different plugin id and stream format and stuff. And this one has some edge cases in logic we couldn't trap because again of state vs bank etc...

Stay tuned!
