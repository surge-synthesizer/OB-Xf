Plan of attack for baconpaul chainsaw attack. This updates as I go. Just keeping it in git
so I dont loose it
  
Plan of attack: clean it up some and understand it then run with paramSet on

- Group programmer buttons - they can do select in group now though
- Does tghe key command handler do anything?
- Broken: MIDI Program Change. Whats the workflow we want?

STUFF TO ADD

- add author field to fxp and make an author tool (even if python)
- Open an issue for better undo
  - Blocks when a program changes or an algo runs
  - Redo
  - A UI adjust

in parallel

- ED does some basic patch browser design
